Per day versioned R ecosystems.

Only days on which Bioconductor changed are available in this repos
git history. 'Changed' means either a release date, or a date on which 
any bioconductor 'software' package was replaced (only for Bioconductor releases >= 3.6).

This goes back to bioconductor 3.0 - after that, no daily CRAN snapshot mirror was 
available.

See https://github.com/TyberiusPrime/cran_tracker_for_nix
for how this is being generated & additional details.

See excluded_packages.txt for packages not included in this build.
