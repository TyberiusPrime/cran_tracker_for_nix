Done:
* what is the appropriate R minor version on each date?
* make it work without running the graph each time (close...)
* write the previously r-packages generated files.
* turn r-packages + what I wrote it into a flake
* version R inside that flake.
* R versioned install nix



Open:
* rpy2 versions? let mach-nix worry about that.
* can we autodetect the 'require X' packgaes
* or  the native build inputs


* is there a difference between 00Archive and Archive? ( symlink?)
* can we exploid data in scr/conttrib/Meta?
